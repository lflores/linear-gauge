* Configurable colors
* Configurable threadsholds
* Width: Default is 200px, but you can chage it.
* Height: Default is 40px, but you can change it.
* Change Event: Each time that you drag threadsholds, the change event is dispatched
* Ticks scale, that divides the gauge 
* Minor ticks scale optional
* Overlaping control
