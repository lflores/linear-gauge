This is a component that use [d3](http://d3js.org/) library and generate a JQuery UI widget, to control colors and thredsholds in a colored gradient background.
Based on [Linear Gauge](http://docs.fusioncharts.com/flex/charts/) Flex components, such as Fusion Charts or [this](http://www.ardisialabs.com/flex-components/linearGauges), this component birth like a personal needs, and I decided to share it.
Once initialized, you can drag thresholds and see changes of color gradients.
Also, you can register an event change ("lineargaugechange") and send result to another component, such as graphic chart.
