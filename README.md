# Linear Gauge
This is a component that use d3 library and generate a JQuery UI widget, to control colors and thredsholds.
Based on [Linear Gauge Flex](http://docs.fusioncharts.com/flex/charts/) such as Fusion Charts, I had the needs to develop one of this in HTML and CSS.

* Width: Default is 200px, but you can chage it.
* Height: Default is 40px, but you can change it.
* Change Event: Each time that you drag threadsholds, the change event is dispatched
